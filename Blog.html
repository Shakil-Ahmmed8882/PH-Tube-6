            <strong>Var: </strong>
            Variables declared with var have function-level scope or global
            scope, depending on where they are declared. This means that they
            are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared
            or globally if declared outside any function. However, var variables
            are not block-scoped, which can lead to unexpected behavior in
            certain situations.
          </p>
          <p class="py-3">
            <strong>Let: </strong>
            Variables declared with let have block-level scope. This means they
            are accessible only within the block (curly braces) in which they
            are declared. They have a more predictable behavior compared to var
            and are recommended for most use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Const:</strong>
            Variables declared with const are also block-scoped like let, but
            they have an additional characteristic: they cannot be reassigned
            after their initial assignment. This makes them suitable for values
            that should not change throughout the scope. However, it's important
            to note that the immutability applies to the binding of the
            variable, not necessarily the value it refers to. Objects and arrays
            declared with const can have their properties or elements modified.

            <strong>undefined: </strong> undefined is a value that indicates a
            variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. It's
            often used as the default value for variables that haven't been
            initialized or for function parameters that are not provided.
          </p>
          <p class="p-3">
            <strong>Null</strong>
            null is a deliberate assignment value that represents the
            intentional absence of any object value. It's often used to indicate
            that a variable intentionally does not contain any value or that an
            object property is intentionally empty.

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="py-3"><strong>REST API: </strong>REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications, especially over the HTTP protocol. REST APIs are designed to enable communication between different software systems by following a set of principles that make the APIs scalable, maintainable, and easy to 
            <p class="py-3"></p><strong>Common concepts: </strong>HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (verbs) to perform actions on resources. The most commonly used HTTP methods in REST are:

            GET: Retrieve data from the server.
            POST: Create new data on the server.
            PUT: Update existing data on the server.
            DELETE: Remove data from the server.
